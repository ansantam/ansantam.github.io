It all started with some scientists wanting to meet in Karlsruhe for an unrelated research project and me wanting to teach what I knew about reinforcement learning to some people I work with.
It all very quickly snowballed and converged into the creation of the **Reinforcement Learning for Autonomous Accelerators (RL4AA)** collaboration.
The kick-off workshop was met with a lot of interest and we are happy to now have a venue dedicated reinforcement learning methods for particle accelerators.
